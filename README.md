# Flutter Examples

This directory contains several examples of using Flutter. To run an example, use `flutter run` inside that demo's directory. 

Flutter apps are written using the **Dart** programming language, also originally from Google and now an ECMA standard. Dart shares many of the same features as other modern languages such as Kotlin and Swift, and can be transcompiled into JavaScript code.

Another unique aspect of Dart is that it can also use **Just-In-Time** or JIT compilation. JIT compilation with Flutter improves the development workflow by allowing **hot reload** capability to refresh the UI during development without the need for an entirely new build.

As youâ€™ll see in these examples, the Flutter framework is heavily built around the idea of **widgets**. In Flutter, widgets are not used just for the views of your app, but also for entire screens and even for the app itself.
